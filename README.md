# GBIF - Extinct

Project to keep track of the latest observations for taxa on GBIF. Currently you cannot easily filter for latest observation of multiple taxa on GBIF. This project should help with a plattform to do so.

## Development

For ease of development we use [cosmtrek/air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) to automatically reload the server when changes are made. See the [config](.air.toml) file for the configuration.

### Tailwind CSS

For the frontend we use the standalone version of [Tailwind CSS Standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).
